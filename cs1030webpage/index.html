<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">About me</h3>
 
 <p> Hello! My name is A.J. Fewkes. I was born in Maryland in 1997. I moved to Roy, Utah
in 2000 and have been living there ever since. Roy is my home; I love the view of
the mountains from my front porch.</p>

<p> I'm currently studying Network Management Technologies at Weber State University
with a minor in English. I also play in WSU's Jazz Ensemble, Symphonic Band, and
Marching Band.</p>

<section id="work">
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">Work</h3>

<p> I spend most of my time working. My goal is to get through college without any
student loans, so I work 3 jobs to pay tuition. I'm an e-commerce processor at ShopKo,
where I manage and ship online orders, A security monitor at Dillard's, where I observe
and record shoplifting crimes to gather evidence for arrests, and a Maintenance
Technician at my local pool, where I manage chemical levels and cleaning. </p>

<p> I work about 50 hours a week during the semester, and close to 80 during school
breaks.</p>

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">My Interests</h3>
<br/>


<section id="interests">

<h4>Music</h4>
<p> Music makes up a large portion of my interests, both in listening and performing.
I've been playing the saxophone for nine years, since deciding to enroll in beginning
band at the start of Junior High School. Band introduced me to a whole range of expressive
music that I hadn't heard before, and taught me the value of music without words; 
cinematographic music (music designed to set a stage or tell a story) has become a large
part of my listening repertoire since I started playing.  I'm not sure who said it, but 
a quote that defines this discovery for me is, "Musicians are artists 
who paint pictures on silence". Joining the Jazz Band at Roy High School in 2013 further
broadened my horizons by introducing me to the realm of Jazz music and Jazz improv.
Jazz has become one of my favorite genres because I feel that improvisation is one of the
purest forms of expression; a musical improvisation is something that has never been heard before
it is played-- and likely will never be heard again after it's finished.</p>

<p> College band has vaulted my playing to a whole new level; harder music required me 
to practice more than I ever have before, and I learn something new every time I go to 
rehearsal. I'm convinced that WSU has the finest music teachers available; A class period
in the band room has never been wasted during my time here.</p>

<p> As for listening, I do a lot of that too. I have what I'd consider to be a very broad
taste; I'll listen to just about anything except for screamo or rap, and even some 
particular songs from those genres don't bother me too much. My activities usually
dictate what's on my playlist. If I'm at the gym or working in the yard, I'll usually choose
nighcore or symphonic metal to listen to, I use video game and film soundtracks while I'm
doing homework, and I lean toward jazz when I want to focus on listening. I don't really have
a favorite song or artist because there are so many musicians' styles that I love for
many different reasons, but I can say that I'm particularly fond of anything with a full
sound. A song I find myself going back to over and over, though is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVY8LoM47xI" id="NorthwestPassage">
Stan Rogers' "Northwest Passage".</a>

<section id="cars">

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline"> Classic Cars </h3>

<p> I've been going to classic car shows since before I could walk. Even now, I have a
special place in my heart for the beautiful lines and shiny paint of old cars, not to mention
an appreciation for the hours and hours of work it takes to maintain and restore them.
Modern cars, both in looks and the way they drive, just don't have the same character
to them, and they're not nearly as fun. </p>

<p>My dad has restored a number of classic automobiles, and his baby is a gorgeous '65 Impala convertible 
that he calls "Sam". He had another '65 Chevy, a Caprice, that he drove as his regular
daily driver until 2003. I loved that car to death as a kid, so he gave it to me when I 
turned 17. I take it to shows and use it as my date night car. I named her "Christine"
after the diabolical Stephen King Plymouth after my friends and I did a spoof of the film
for a Spanish class while we were in High School. </p>

<p> My daily driver is my grandfather's retired work truck, a 1976 Chevy Silverado. 
It's got a big 454-cubic inch V8 engine that drinks gasoline like no other, it leaks
like a sieve in the summer, and it's got more nicks, dings, and dents than dollars
the government doesn't. However, despite all its flaws, I wouldn't give it up for the
world. Besides the fact that it was my granddad's, driving it every day is just plain
fun. </p>

<section id="Memes">
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">Memes</h3>
<p> I personally believe that memes are the lifeblood of modern American culture and
the best way ever created to waste time. are you bored? Look at memes!  Are you sad?
Look at memes! Is your friend sad? Show them some memes! Memes can provide a solution
to any emotional problem the world has to offer. </p>

<section id="VideoGames">
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline"> Video Games </h3>

<p> When I'm not working, at school, or fixing my truck, I spend a lot of time playing
video games, both classic and modern. Over the last ten years are so, I've built my
collection to more than 400 games on over 20 systems, both modern and classic (more
than enough to keep me entertained for years to come, but that's not gonna stop
me from growing it even futher!).</p>

<p> Much like songs, there are so many beautiful games with so many beautiful, unique
qualities that it's hard for me to decide on a favorite. However, I can say that my
favorite series by far is Final Fantasy. The combination of strategy and story captured
me from the very first time I tried the series. Although I'm not sure I can call it my 
favorite game, but my favorite entry in the series is Final Fantasy VII. Its juxtaposition
of steampunk and fantasy themes in a vast 3D world has stolen nearly 200 hours of my
life, and I'll never regret giving those up. </p>

<p> The game I've spent the most time playing in the last few years is Destiny, but 
currently I'm bouncing between a horror game called Yomawari, a fighting adventure
game called Yakuza, and NieR: Automata, a dark and whimsical JRPG about androids. </p>

<section id="WeebStuff">

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline"> Anime/Manga </h3>

<p> More than anything in the world, I love stories. I've found that one of the most
beautiful and dynamic ways to tell a story is manga and anime. I do love to watch anime,
but I read a lot more manga than watch anime. It's a little odd to get used to turning
pages the opposite direction to what you're used to, but discovery of the medium was
worth all of my confusion in the end. I've found many
more meaningful lessons and connections to my own life in anime and manga then any
other form of entertainment. Unlike video games, however, I can easily point out my top
5 manga.</p>
